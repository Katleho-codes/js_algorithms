// Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching name and value pairs

// from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.

// Code Explanation
// We filter through the collection using .filter().
// Next, we return a Boolean value for the .filter() method.
// Finally, we reduce to Boolean value to be returned for the .every() method.
